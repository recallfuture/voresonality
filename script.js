Once they have their prey, active predators will likely want to get right to the point, and also probably won't be afraid to apply a little force to get what they want.

Passive predators can also simply not see themselves as predators, or try to resist their hunger when they're around prey (often failing to do so when the temptation becomes too much). Passive prey, naturally, tends to submit once the predator has them in their grasp- giving in for a host of possible reasons ranging from subservience to despair to sexual thrill. Willing types will happily subject themselves to their predator's whims, serving the role of 'toy' or 'food' with few objections.
